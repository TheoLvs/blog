## Who am I?

Lead Data Scientist & Manager at <a href='https://ekimetrics.com/'>Ekimetrics</a>, and Co-Lead of the NGO <a href='http://dataforgood.fr/'>Data For Good</a> I am passionate about building (not-always-useful) stuff using Machine Learning. In particular I write <a href="/blog">articles</a> and <a href="/opensource">code open source libraries</a> to democratize Reinforcement Learning, genetic algorithms, multi-agent simulations, cellular automata, and more.

In this website, you will find what I've been working on in my personal time, from raw experiments, open source libraries, or resources I love.  

## Why **emergence.pub**?
**Emergence** or abiogenesis is the process of creating life from non-living matter. As a computer scientists, it resonates with the process of building programs that live on their own. My work has been focusing on this global idea, from Reinforcement Learning to evolutionary algorithms and cellular automata, to also try to expand my understanding in the sometimes narrow concept of Artificial Intelligence.
